# CHANGELOG #

## Version ... ##

* fixed bug where last line in a source file would not be read if it did
  not end in a newline
* added conditional breakpoints
* when called with `-l file` argument, debug.lua will now also log all
  pinned expressions to the output log whenever they're updated.

## Version 0.9 ##

* removed (R)estart command, misunderstood what it does.
* no longer exits when the client exits, instead returns to the startup
  screen. Exits only on q command.
* d now also prefills input with db <current_line> if current line has a
  breakpoint
* made colors configurable (in a way... you need to edit a table in the
  source code)
* added optional quit on client exit
* added support for lua skripts with #! at the start
* added search in current source file

## Version 0.8 ##

* initial release
